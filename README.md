# TSP Exercise

This repository contains the solution to the TSP problem implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `TSP.ipynb` by the student Luca Ianniello, s327313.

## Algorithm Description

## Initialization
The initialization step allows to decide if start the algorithm using a greedy approach or a random path approach. The selection is done using the variable `select_initialization`. 

## Algorithms
The algorithm application allows to decide if use a mutation strategy approach or a crossover strategy approach. This selection is done using the variable `algorithm_selection`.

### Mutation Strategy
The `mutation_algorithm` function operates as follows:

### Initialization
The function begins by setting the current best population and calculating the initial best fitness (cost) using the `tsp_cost` function.

### Main Loop
- The function iterates for the specified number of iterations.
- For each iteration, a copy of the current best population is created as `new_population`.

### Mutation Process
A mutation is applied with a probability defined by `mutation_rate`. If a random number is less than this rate, the function:
- Mutates the paths in `new_population` by swapping a specified number of cities (using the `mutate` function).
- Applies a local search to further refine the mutated paths (using the `local_search` function).

### Fitness Evaluation
The fitness of the new population is evaluated using the `tsp_cost` function. If the new fitness is better than the best fitness recorded:
- The best population is updated.
- The best fitness is updated.
- The number of swaps is decreased to focus on exploitation.

### Adaptive Mutation Rate
If no improvement is found:
- The mutation rate is adjusted based on the difference in fitness, promoting exploration.
- The number of swaps is increased to encourage further exploration.

### Decay of Mutation Rate
The mutation rate is gradually decreased over time, promoting convergence as the algorithm progresses.

## Crossover algorithm
The `crossover_algorithm` function operates as follows:

### Initialization:
- The algorithm initializes a `population` containing the input `path` and additional paths generated by the `initialize_population` function.

### Evolution:
- For each generation, a new population (`next_generation`) is created.
  - **Selection**: Two parents are selected from the population using `tournament_selection`.
  - **Crossover**: The `inv_crossover` function is used to produce a child tour from the two parents.
  - **Mutation**: With probability equal to `mutation_rate`, the child is mutated.
  - **Survival**: If the child has a lower cost than either parent, it is added to the next generation. Otherwise, a random parent is retained.

### Progress Reporting:
- Every 10 generations, the algorithm prints the best fitness (i.e., shortest tour) in the population.

### Termination:
- After completing all generations, the function returns the `best_tour` from the final population. This tour represents the shortest path found by the algorithm.
